## About

This is a php library designed to be used with the [Codeignitor](http://www.codeignitor.com) framework.

** This library is not done yet **

Codeigniter has a really nice form validation library. The problem with modern web programing is people 
expect validation to be done in javascript to save the person from reloading this page. Programers concern 
with security often end up validating in javascript and then in php on the server side. It is the goal
of this wrapper library to have the magic of both server side validation and ajax. 

More details about all this when library is done.
